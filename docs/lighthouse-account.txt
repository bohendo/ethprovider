USAGE:
    lighthouse account_manager validator [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
        --disable-malloc-tuning    If present, do not configure the system allocator. Providing this flag will generally
                                   increase memory usage, it should only be provided when debugging specific memory
                                   allocation issues.
    -h, --help                     Prints help information
    -V, --version                  Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -d, --datadir <DIR>
            Used to specify a custom root data directory for lighthouse keys and databases. Defaults to
            $HOME/.lighthouse/{network} where network is the value of the `network` flag Note: Users should specify
            separate custom datadirs for different networks.
        --debug-level <LEVEL>
            The verbosity level for emitting logs. [default: info]  [possible values: info, debug, trace, warn, error,
            crit]
        --network <network>
            Name of the Eth2 chain Lighthouse will sync and follow. [possible values: medalla, altona, spadina, pyrmont,
            mainnet, toledo, prater]
    -s, --spec <DEPRECATED>
            This flag is deprecated, it will be disallowed in a future release. This value is now derived from the
            --network or --testnet-dir flags.
    -t, --testnet-dir <DIR>
            Path to directory containing eth2_testnet specs. Defaults to a hard-coded Lighthouse testnet. Only effective
            if there is no existing database.
        --validator-dir <VALIDATOR_DIRECTORY>
            The path to search for validator directories. Defaults to ~/.lighthouse/{network}/validators


SUBCOMMANDS:
    create                 Creates new validators from an existing EIP-2386 wallet using the EIP-2333 HD key
                           derivation scheme.
    exit                   Submits a VoluntaryExit to the beacon chain for a given validator keystore.
    help                   Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    import                 Imports one or more EIP-2335 passwords into a Lighthouse VC directory, requesting
                           passwords interactively. The directory flag provides a convenient method for importing a
                           directory of keys generated by the eth2-deposit-cli Python utility.
    list                   Lists the public keys of all validators.
    recover                Recovers validator private keys given a BIP-39 mnemonic phrase. If you did not specify a
                           `--first-index` or count `--count`, by default this will only recover the keys associated
                           with the validator at index 0 for an HD wallet in accordance with the EIP-2333 spec.
    slashing-protection    Import or export slashing protection data to or from another client
