lighthouse-account_manager-validator-import
Imports one or more EIP-2335 passwords into a Lighthouse VC directory, requesting passwords interactively. The directory
flag provides a convenient method for importing a directory of keys generated by the eth2-deposit-cli Python utility.

USAGE:
    lighthouse account_manager validator import [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] --directory <KEYSTORES_DIRECTORY> --keystore <KEYSTORE_PATH>

FLAGS:
        --disable-malloc-tuning    If present, do not configure the system allocator. Providing this flag will generally
                                   increase memory usage, it should only be provided when debugging specific memory
                                   allocation issues.
    -h, --help                     Prints help information
        --reuse-password           If present, the same password will be used for all imported keystores.
        --stdin-inputs             If present, read all user inputs from stdin instead of tty.
    -V, --version                  Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -d, --datadir <DIR>
            Used to specify a custom root data directory for lighthouse keys and databases. Defaults to
            $HOME/.lighthouse/{network} where network is the value of the `network` flag Note: Users should specify
            separate custom datadirs for different networks.
        --debug-level <LEVEL>
            The verbosity level for emitting logs. [default: info]  [possible values: info, debug, trace, warn, error,
            crit]
        --directory <KEYSTORES_DIRECTORY>
            Path to a directory which contains zero or more keystores for import. This directory and all sub-directories
            will be searched and any file name which contains 'keystore' and has the '.json' extension will be attempted
            to be imported.
        --keystore <KEYSTORE_PATH>                  Path to a single keystore to be imported.
        --network <network>
            Name of the Eth2 chain Lighthouse will sync and follow. [possible values: medalla, altona, spadina, pyrmont,
            mainnet, toledo, prater]
        --password-file <KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_PATH>
            The path to the file containing the password which will unlock all keystores being imported. This flag must
            be used with `--reuse-password`. The password will be copied to the `validator_definitions.yml` file, so
            after import we strongly recommend you delete the file at KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_PATH.
    -s, --spec <DEPRECATED>
            This flag is deprecated, it will be disallowed in a future release. This value is now derived from the
            --network or --testnet-dir flags.
    -t, --testnet-dir <DIR>
            Path to directory containing eth2_testnet specs. Defaults to a hard-coded Lighthouse testnet. Only effective
            if there is no existing database.
