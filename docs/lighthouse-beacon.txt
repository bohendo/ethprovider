lighthouse-beacon_node 1.0.6
Sigma Prime <contact@sigmaprime.io>
The primary component which connects to the Ethereum 2.0 P2P network and downloads, verifies and stores blocks. Provides
a HTTP API for querying the beacon chain and publishing messages to the network.

USAGE:
    lighthouse beacon_node [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
        --compact-db                 If present, apply compaction to the database on start-up. Use with caution. It is
                                     generally not recommended unless auto-compaction is disabled.
        --disable-discovery          Disables the discv5 discovery protocol. The node will not search for new peers or
                                     participate in the discovery protocol.
        --disable-upnp               Disables UPnP support. Setting this will prevent Lighthouse from attempting to
                                     automatically establish external port mappings.
        --dummy-eth1                 If present, uses an eth1 backend that generates static dummy data.Identical to the
                                     method used at the 2019 Canada interop.
    -e, --enr-match                  Sets the local ENR IP address and port to match those set for lighthouse.
                                     Specifically, the IP address will be the value of --listen-address and the UDP port
                                     will be --discovery-port.
        --eth1                       If present the node will connect to an eth1 node. This is required for block
                                     production, you must use this flag if you wish to serve a validator.
        --eth1-purge-cache           Purges the eth1 block and deposit caches
    -h, --help                       Prints help information
        --http                       Enable the RESTful HTTP API server. Disabled by default.
        --import-all-attestations    Import and aggregate all attestations, regardless of validator subscriptions. This
                                     will only import attestations from already-subscribed subnets, use with
                                     --subscribe-all-subnets to ensure all attestations are received for import.
        --metrics                    Enable the Prometheus metrics HTTP server. Disabled by default.
        --private                    Prevents sending various client identification information.
        --purge-db                   If present, the chain database will be deleted. Use with caution.
        --slasher                    Run a slasher alongside the beacon node. It is currently only recommended for
                                     expert users because of the immaturity of the slasher UX and the extra resources
                                     required.
        --slasher-broadcast          Broadcast slashings found by the slasher to the rest of the network [disabled by
                                     default].
        --staking                    Standard option for a staking beacon node. Equivalent to `lighthouse bn --http
                                     --eth1 `. This will enable the http server on localhost:5052 and try connecting to
                                     an eth1 node on localhost:8545
        --subscribe-all-subnets      Subscribe to all subnets regardless of validator count. This will also advertise
                                     the beacon node as being long-lived subscribed to all subnets.
    -V, --version                    Prints version information
    -z, --zero-ports                 Sets all listening TCP/UDP ports to 0, allowing the OS to choose some arbitrary
                                     free ports.

OPTIONS:
        --auto-compact-db <auto-compact-db>
            Enable or disable automatic compaction of the database on finalization. [default: true]

        --block-cache-size <SIZE>

        --boot-nodes <ENR/MULTIADDR LIST>
            One or more comma-delimited base64-encoded ENR's to bootstrap the p2p network. Multiaddr is also supported.

    -d, --datadir <DIR>
            Used to specify a custom root data directory for lighthouse keys and databases. Defaults to
            $HOME/.lighthouse/{network} where network is the value of the `network` flag Note: Users should specify
            separate custom datadirs for different networks.
        --debug-level <LEVEL>
            The verbosity level for emitting logs. [default: info]  [possible values: info, debug, trace, warn, error,
            crit]
    -x, --disable-enr-auto-update <disable-enr-auto-update>
            Discovery automatically updates the nodes local ENR with an external IP address and port as seen by other
            peers on the network. This disables this feature, fixing the ENR's IP/PORT to those specified on boot.
        --discovery-port <PORT>
            The UDP port that discovery will listen on. Defaults to `port`

        --enr-address <ADDRESS>
            The IP address/ DNS address to broadcast to other peers on how to reach this node. If a DNS address is
            provided, the enr-address is set to the IP address it resolves to and does not auto-update based on PONG
            responses in discovery. Set this only if you are sure other nodes can connect to your local node on this
            address. Discovery will automatically find your external address,if possible.
        --enr-tcp-port <PORT>
            The TCP port of the local ENR. Set this only if you are sure other nodes can connect to your local node on
            this port.The --port flag is used if this is not set.
        --enr-udp-port <PORT>
            The UDP port of the local ENR. Set this only if you are sure other nodes can connect to your local node on
            this port.
        --eth1-blocks-per-log-query <BLOCKS>
            Specifies the number of blocks that a deposit log query should span. This will reduce the size of responses
            from the Eth1 endpoint. [default: 1000]
        --eth1-endpoint <HTTP-ENDPOINT>                        Deprecated. Use --eth1-endpoints.
        --eth1-endpoints <HTTP-ENDPOINTS>
            One or more comma-delimited server endpoints for web3 connection. If multiple endpoints are given the
            endpoints are used as fallback in the given order. Also enables the --eth1 flag. Defaults to
            http://127.0.0.1:8545.
        --freezer-dir <DIR>                                    Data directory for the freezer database.
        --graffiti <GRAFFITI>

        --http-allow-origin <ORIGIN>
            Set the value of the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response HTTP header. Use * to allow any origin (not
            recommended in production). If no value is supplied, the CORS allowed origin is set to the listen address of
            this server (e.g., http://localhost:5052).
        --http-port <PORT>
            Set the listen TCP port for the RESTful HTTP API server. [default: 5052]

        --libp2p-addresses <MULTIADDR>
            One or more comma-delimited multiaddrs to manually connect to a libp2p peer without an ENR.

        --listen-address <ADDRESS>
            The address lighthouse will listen for UDP and TCP connections. [default: 0.0.0.0]

        --max-skip-slots <NUM_SLOTS>
            Refuse to skip more than this many slots when processing a block or attestation. This prevents nodes on
            minority forks from wasting our time and disk space, but could also cause unnecessary consensus failures, so
            is disabled by default.
        --metrics-address <ADDRESS>

    -s, --spec <DEPRECATED>
            This flag is deprecated, it will be disallowed in a future release. This value is now derived from the
            --network or --testnet-dir flags.
        --target-peers <target-peers>                          The target number of peers. [default: 50]
    -t, --testnet-dir <DIR>
            Path to directory containing eth2_testnet specs. Defaults to a hard-coded Lighthouse testnet. Only effective
            if there is no existing database.
        --trusted-peers <TRUSTED_PEERS>
