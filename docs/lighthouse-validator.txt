lighthouse-validator_client 
When connected to a beacon node, performs the duties of a staked validator (e.g., proposing blocks and attestations).

USAGE:
    lighthouse validator_client [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
        --allow-unsynced              If present, the validator client will still poll for duties if the beacon
                                                            node is not synced.
        --delete-lockfiles            DEPRECATED. This flag does nothing and will be removed in a future release.
        --disable-auto-discover       If present, do not attempt to discover new validators in the validators-dir.
                                      Validators will need to be manually added to the validator_definitions.yml file.
    -h, --help                        Prints help information
        --http                        Enable the RESTful HTTP API server. Disabled by default.
        --init-slashing-protection    If present, do not require the slashing protection database to exist before
                                      running. You SHOULD NOT use this flag unless you're certain that a new slashing
                                      protection database is required. Usually, your database will have been initialized
                                      when you imported your validator keys. If you misplace your database and then run
                                      with this flag you risk being slashed.
        --metrics                     Enable the Prometheus metrics HTTP server. Disabled by default.
    -V, --version                     Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --beacon-node <NETWORK_ADDRESS>       Deprecated. Use --beacon-nodes.
        --beacon-nodes <NETWORK_ADDRESSES>    Comma-separated addresses to one or more beacon node HTTP APIs. Default is
                                              http://localhost:5052.
    -d, --datadir <DIR>                       Used to specify a custom root data directory for lighthouse keys and
                                              databases. Defaults to $HOME/.lighthouse/{network} where network is the
                                              value of the `network` flag Note: Users should specify separate custom
                                              datadirs for different networks.
        --debug-level <LEVEL>                 The verbosity level for emitting logs. [default: info]  [possible values:
                                              info, debug, trace, warn, error, crit]
        --graffiti <GRAFFITI>                 Specify your custom graffiti to be included in blocks.
        --http-allow-origin <ORIGIN>          Set the value of the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response HTTP header. Use
                                              * to allow any origin (not recommended in production). If no value is
                                              supplied, the CORS allowed origin is set to the listen address of this
                                              server (e.g., http://localhost:5062).
        --http-port <PORT>                    Set the listen TCP port for the RESTful HTTP API server. This server does
                                              **not** provide encryption and is completely unsuitable to expose to a
                                              public network. We do not provide a --http-address flag and restrict the
                                              user to listening on 127.0.0.1. For access via the Internet, apply a
                                              transport-layer security like a HTTPS reverse-proxy or SSH tunnelling.
                                              [default: 5062]
        --metrics-address <ADDRESS>           Set the listen address for the Prometheus metrics HTTP server. [default:
                                              127.0.0.1]
        --metrics-allow-origin <ORIGIN>       Set the value of the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response HTTP header. Use
                                              * to allow any origin (not recommended in production). If no value is
                                              supplied, the CORS allowed origin is set to the listen address of this
                                              server (e.g., http://localhost:5064).
        --metrics-port <PORT>                 Set the listen TCP port for the Prometheus metrics HTTP server. [default:
                                              5064]
        --network <network>                   Name of the Eth2 chain Lighthouse will sync and follow. [possible values:
                                              medalla, altona, spadina, pyrmont, mainnet, toledo]
        --secrets-dir <SECRETS_DIRECTORY>     The directory which contains the password to unlock the validator voting
                                              keypairs. Each password should be contained in a file where the name is
                                              the 0x-prefixed hex representation of the validators voting public key.
                                              Defaults to ~/.lighthouse/{network}/secrets.
        --server <NETWORK_ADDRESS>            Deprecated. Use --beacon-nodes.
    -s, --spec <DEPRECATED>                   This flag is deprecated, it will be disallowed in a future release. This
                                              value is now derived from the --network or --testnet-dir flags.
    -t, --testnet-dir <DIR>                   Path to directory containing eth2_testnet specs. Defaults to a hard-coded
                                              Lighthouse testnet. Only effective if there is no existing database.
        --validators-dir <VALIDATORS_DIR>     The directory which contains the validator keystores, deposit data for
                                              each validator along with the common slashing protection database and the
                                              validator_definitions.yml
